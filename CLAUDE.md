# ZZ Development Rules

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are canonical mirrors. Keep them byte-for-byte identical whenever either file changes.

## Project Identity

- The public project and CLI name is **ZZ**. The executable is `zz`, the default config root is `~/.zz`, and project-local agent assets live under `.zz/`.
- The upstream project is `can1357/oh-my-pi`; this fork is developed at `Fred-Ko/zz`.
- Preserve upstream-compatible package scopes and internal protocol identifiers (`@oh-my-pi/*`, `__omp_worker_*`, legacy environment variables) when changing them would break compatibility. New user-facing text, commands, paths, and examples use ZZ naming.
- Korean is the default language for user-facing conversation and built-in messages unless the user explicitly selects another language. Code identifiers, protocol fields, and upstream API names remain in their established language.
- Relational persistence added by this fork uses `bun:sqlite`. Do not introduce PostgreSQL or another RDBMS unless the user explicitly changes this architecture.
- Automatic QA reporting was removed. Do not reintroduce `report_tool_issue`, `xd://report_issue`, grievance storage/push, consent UI, or equivalent model-driven telemetry.
- The upstream legacy memory subsystem, Mnemopi, transcript auto-retain/auto-recall, `memory://`, `/memory`, and the legacy memory tools are removed. Do not reintroduce or build ZZ Knowledge on top of them.
- ZZ Knowledge is an independent policy layer under `packages/coding-agent/src/knowledge/`. Hindsight is only its advisory semantic store. Registry, Git, workspace state, operation journal, and verification evidence remain authoritative.

## Development Guide Map

Read the smallest relevant guide before changing a subsystem:

- [`develop-guide-docs/README.md`](develop-guide-docs/README.md) — guide index and first-day checklist
- [`develop-guide-docs/project-identity.md`](develop-guide-docs/project-identity.md) — project mission, identity, product layers, and non-goals
- [`develop-guide-docs/design-philosophy.md`](develop-guide-docs/design-philosophy.md) — authority, prompt/tool/runtime separation, approvals, evidence, and memory principles
- [`develop-guide-docs/product-workflows.md`](develop-guide-docs/product-workflows.md) — user-facing ordinary Goal, ZZW, recovery, and Knowledge flows
- [`develop-guide-docs/architecture.md`](develop-guide-docs/architecture.md) — package boundaries and runtime flow
- [`develop-guide-docs/architecture-decisions.md`](develop-guide-docs/architecture-decisions.md) — accepted, replaced, and deferred architecture decisions
- [`develop-guide-docs/engineering-guidelines.md`](develop-guide-docs/engineering-guidelines.md) — implementation, persistence, TUI, testing, and documentation quality rules
- [`develop-guide-docs/development-workflow.md`](develop-guide-docs/development-workflow.md) — setup, implementation, tests, build, and installation
- [`develop-guide-docs/controlled-workflow.md`](develop-guide-docs/controlled-workflow.md) — ZZWorkflow(ZZW), Plan DAG, local SQLite recovery, operations, and evidence
- [`develop-guide-docs/parallel-execution.md`](develop-guide-docs/parallel-execution.md) — ZZW Execution Wave, resource claims, parallel validation/subagents, integration, and recovery
- [`develop-guide-docs/knowledge-system.md`](develop-guide-docs/knowledge-system.md) — independent ZZ Knowledge policy, Hindsight wrapper, outbox, and mental models
- [`develop-guide-docs/upstream-and-release.md`](develop-guide-docs/upstream-and-release.md) — upstream synchronization, fork pushing, and release policy

Historical source:

- [`develop-guide-docs/initial-concept-archive.md`](develop-guide-docs/initial-concept-archive.md) — pre-implementation ideas preserved for design history; never use it as a current specification, implementation contract, or development authority

## Development Documentation Maintenance

- Keep current developer architecture, concepts, decisions, and internal procedures under `develop-guide-docs/`. Keep user-facing command and configuration reference under `docs/`, and package-specific public API guidance in the relevant `packages/*/README.md`.
- Every current guide must state its authority/status near the top. Historical documents must be explicitly marked non-authoritative and link to the current replacement documents.
- Treat `initial-concept-archive.md` as a preserved historical record. Do not rewrite its original proposals to match the current implementation, and do not revive its discarded `workflowd`, multi-machine coordinator, or legacy memory assumptions by citing the archive. Add current decisions to `architecture-decisions.md` and the relevant subsystem guide instead.
- When code changes product identity, user flow, commands, settings, package boundaries, persistence paths, state transitions, approval behavior, Knowledge policy, installation, or release behavior, update the owning current guide in the same change.
- Update `project-identity.md` for mission/non-goal changes, `design-philosophy.md` for cross-cutting principles, `product-workflows.md` for user journeys, `architecture.md` for runtime/package boundaries, and `architecture-decisions.md` for accepted/replaced/deferred decisions.
- Update `controlled-workflow.md` for ZZW contracts and `knowledge-system.md` for ZZ Knowledge contracts. Keep those systems independent: ZZW owns current task execution state; Knowledge owns advisory durable knowledge policy.
- Update `parallel-execution.md` whenever ZZW ready-set scheduling, resource claims, Wave/Lane state, validation fan-out, subagent isolation, patch integration, cancellation, or parallel recovery changes.
- Update `engineering-guidelines.md` when implementation or test standards change, `development-workflow.md` when runnable commands or installation steps change, and `upstream-and-release.md` when fork synchronization or release policy changes.
- Verify documented commands and setting keys against their actual registries/schemas. Verify local Markdown links, run the repository formatter for changed current guides, and run `git diff --check` before handoff.
- When renaming or removing a guide, update this map, `develop-guide-docs/README.md`, all incoming links, and any public docs that reference it. Do not use vague current-guide names such as `custom`, `new`, or `current`.
- Avoid copying the same contract into multiple guides. Keep one canonical explanation in the owning guide and link to it elsewhere so the documents do not drift.
- Whenever either root instruction file changes, apply the exact same edit to both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` and verify they remain byte-for-byte identical.

## Agent Operating Rules

- Unless the user requests another language, communicate with the user in Korean.
- Inspect repository evidence before asking questions answerable from code, configuration, Git, or tests.
- Preserve unrelated local changes. Never overwrite, reset, clean, or discard a dirty worktree to simplify a task.
- Do not commit, push, open a pull request, publish, or write on GitHub unless the user explicitly requests that external action.
- If elevated privileges are required, use `pkexec`; never use `sudo`.
- Prefer focused verification during iteration, then expand verification in proportion to the affected subsystem and risk.
- State which checks were run and distinguish new failures from known unrelated environmental failures.

## Default Context

This repo contains multiple packages, but **`packages/coding-agent/`** is the primary focus. Unless otherwise specified, assume work refers to this package.

**Terminology**: When the user says "agent" or asks "why is agent doing X", they mean the **coding-agent package implementation**, not you (the assistant). The coding-agent is a CLI tool — questions about its behavior refer to code in `packages/coding-agent/`, not your current session.

### Package Structure

| Package                 | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/ai`           | Multi-provider LLM client with streaming support                                        |
| `packages/catalog`      | Model catalog: bundled models.json, provider descriptors, model identity/classification |
| `packages/agent`        | Agent runtime with tool calling and state management                                    |
| `packages/coding-agent` | Main CLI application (primary focus)                                                    |
| `packages/tui`          | Terminal UI library with differential rendering                                         |
| `packages/natives`      | Bindings for native text/image/grep operations                                          |
| `packages/stats`        | Local observability dashboard (`zz stats`)                                              |
| `packages/utils`        | Shared utilities (logger, streams, temp files)                                          |
| `packages/wire`         | Shared protocol types                                                                   |
| `packages/collab-web`   | Browser client and tool renderer bundle                                                 |
| `crates/pi-natives`     | Rust crate for performance-critical text/grep ops                                       |

**Catalog import convention**: code in this repo imports catalog _values_ (bundled models, model-thinking helpers, identity, descriptors, model manager/cache) from `@oh-my-pi/pi-catalog/<module>` — never via `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`. The pi-ai barrel re-exports only the model/effort _types_ its own signatures use (`Model`, `Api`, `ThinkingConfig`, `Effort`, …); type-only imports of those from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` are fine.

## GitHub

Unless user tells you exactly what to write:

- **Never comment on GitHub** (issues, PRs, discussions).
- **Never create issues on GitHub**.

## Code Quality

- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **NEVER use `ReturnType<>`** — use the actual type name.
- **NEVER use inline imports** — no `await import()`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic type imports. Always top-level.
- Check `node_modules` for external API types instead of guessing.
- **Barrel exports**: prefer `export * from "./module"` over named re-exports, including `export type { ... } from`. In pure `index.ts` barrels, use star re-exports even for single-specifier cases. If stars create ambiguity, remove the redundant export path; do not keep duplicates.
- **Class privacy**: use ES `#private` fields; leave externally accessible members bare. **No `private`/`protected`/`public` keyword on fields or methods**, except on **constructor parameter properties** where TypeScript requires it (e.g. `constructor(private readonly session: ToolSession)`).
- **Promises**: use `Promise.withResolvers()` instead of `new Promise((resolve, reject) => ...)`.
- **Prompts**: never build prompts in code (no inline strings, template literals, or concatenation). Prompts live in static `.md` files; use Handlebars for dynamic content. Import them via `import content from "./prompt.md" with { type: "text" }` — not `readFile`.
- **Worker scripts**: workers re-enter the CLI entrypoint; never spawn separate worker entry modules. `cli.ts` declares itself as the worker host at startup (`declareWorkerHostEntry()` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/env`) and dispatches hidden argv selectors (`__omp_worker_stats_sync`, `__omp_worker_tab`, `__omp_worker_js_eval`, `__omp_worker_tiny_inference`) before loading the command registry. Spawn sites use:
  ```ts
  import { workerHostEntry } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";
  const hostEntry = workerHostEntry();
  const worker = hostEntry
    ? new Worker(hostEntry, { type: "module", argv: ["__omp_worker_<name>"] })
    : new Worker(new URL("./<worker>.ts", import.meta.url).href, {
        type: "module",
      });
  ```
  When the process was started from the ZZ CLI — source `cli.ts`, npm-bundle `dist/cli.js`, or compiled binary — `workerHostEntry()` is `Bun.main` and the worker re-enters the single entry module, so no per-worker `--compile` entrypoints or bundle entries exist. Outside a CLI host (`bun test`, SDK embedding, standalone stats tooling) it returns `null` and the direct-module fallback loads the worker source. New worker kinds MUST add their selector to the dispatch table in `cli.ts` and keep the fallback branch.
  History: `with { type: "file" }` only copied the entry as a raw asset (workers crashed silently in compiled binaries — issues #1011, #1027), and the later literal-path + extra-entrypoint pattern required keeping spawn literals and two build scripts in sync (issue #1150). The smoke probe below is the live validation of this contract.
  Validate any new worker with the dedicated smoke probe: `zz --smoke-test` spawns the stats sync worker and the tiny-model subprocess, pings them, and exits — it's wired into `ci:test:smoke` and `scripts/install-tests/run-ci.sh` so binary, source-link, and tarball installs all exercise it. Add a sibling smoke if the new worker is on a different module graph.

## Central Utilities

Before writing a helper, check whether one already exists — `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui`, and the domain modules next to your callsite. This applies to **everything**: VCS wrappers, formatting/truncation/path-display helpers, image handling, clipboard, streams, temp files, caching. The central versions carry hardening a fresh copy always loses (timeouts, output caps, non-interactive env, lock avoidance, caching, TUI sanitization).

- Search first with `rg`/`rg --files` for the operation before implementing it. Two implementations of the same thing is a bug even when both work.
- Examples of the pattern: `src/utils/git.ts` and `src/utils/jj.ts` are the only sanctioned way to run git/jj (`import * as git from "../utils/git"` — never hand-spawn via `$`/`Bun.spawn`); rendering goes through the helpers in TUI Sanitization below (`replaceTabs`, `truncateToWidth`, `shortenPath`, `PREVIEW_LIMITS`) rather than ad-hoc string math.
- Missing capability? Extend the central helper (new option, new sub-function on the namespace) and call it — don't fork its logic locally.

## Bun Over Node

Use Bun APIs where they provide a cleaner alternative; fall back to `node:*` only for what Bun doesn't cover. **Never spawn shell commands for operations with proper APIs** (e.g., don't `Bun.spawnSync(["mkdir", "-p", dir])` — use `mkdirSync`).

### Quick reference

| Operation       | Use                                       | Not                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| File read/write | `Bun.file()`, `Bun.write()`               | `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`    |
| Spawn process   | `` $`cmd` ``, `Bun.spawn()`               | `child_process`                    |
| Sleep           | `Bun.sleep(ms)`                           | `setTimeout` promise               |
| Binary lookup   | `$which("git")` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils` | `spawnSync(["which", "git"])`      |
| HTTP server     | `Bun.serve()`                             | `http.createServer()`              |
| SQLite          | `bun:sqlite`                              | `better-sqlite3`                   |
| Hashing         | `Bun.hash()`, `Bun.password.*`, WebCrypto | `node:crypto`                      |
| Path resolution | `import.meta.dir`, `import.meta.path`     | `fileURLToPath` dance              |
| JSON5           | `Bun.JSON5.parse()` / `.stringify()`      | `json5` package                    |
| JSONL           | `Bun.JSONL.parse()` / `.parseChunk()`     | `text.split("\n").map(JSON.parse)` |
| String width    | `Bun.stringWidth()`                       | `get-east-asian-width`, custom     |
| Text wrapping   | `Bun.wrapAnsi()`                          | custom ANSI-aware wrappers         |

### Process execution

Prefer Bun Shell (`` $`cmd` ``) for simple commands:

```typescript
import { $ } from "bun";

const result = await $`git status`.cwd(dir).quiet().nothrow();
if (result.exitCode === 0) {
  const text = result.text();
}

$`do-stuff ${tmpFile}`.quiet().nothrow(); // fire and forget
```

Methods: `.quiet()`, `.nothrow()`, `.text()`, `.cwd(path)`.

Use `Bun.spawn`/`Bun.spawnSync` only for: long-running processes (LSP, kernels), streaming stdin/stdout/stderr (SSE, JSON-RPC), or process control (signals, kill, complex lifecycle).

When using `pipe` mode, cast the stream:

```typescript
const child = Bun.spawn(["cmd"], { stdout: "pipe", stderr: "pipe" });
const reader = (child.stdout as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>).getReader();
```

### Node module imports

Always use **namespace imports** for `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:os`:

```typescript
import * as fs from "node:fs/promises";
import * as path from "node:path";
import * as os from "node:os";
```

- Async-only file → `node:fs/promises`.
- Needs both sync and async → `node:fs`, then `fs.promises.xxx` for async.

### File I/O

Prefer Bun:

```typescript
const text = await Bun.file(path).text();
const data = await Bun.file(path).json();
await Bun.write(path, data); // auto-creates parent dirs
```

Use `node:fs/promises` for directory ops (`fs.mkdir`, `fs.rm`, `fs.readdir`) — Bun has no native directory APIs. Avoid sync APIs in async flows; use sync only when forced by a synchronous interface.

**Anti-patterns:**

- `existsSync`/`readFileSync`/`writeFileSync` in async code → `Bun.file()` APIs.
- `mkdir(dirname(path), …)` before `Bun.write(path, …)` → redundant; `Bun.write` handles it.
- `if (await file.exists()) { await file.json() }` → two syscalls plus race. Use try-catch with `isEnoent`:
  ```typescript
  import { isEnoent } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";
  try {
    return await Bun.file(path).json();
  } catch (err) {
    if (isEnoent(err)) return null;
    throw err;
  }
  ```
- Multiple `Bun.file(path)` handles for the same path (including across `checkX`/`loadX` helpers).
- `Buffer.from(await Bun.file(x).arrayBuffer())` → `await fs.readFile(path)`.
- Existence check + try-catch around the same read → drop the existence check.

### Streams

Prefer centralized helpers:

```typescript
import { readStream, readLines } from "./utils/stream";
const text = await readStream(child.stdout);
for await (const line of readLines(stream)) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Manual reader loops only when the protocol requires it (SSE, streaming JSON-RPC).

### Misc

- **Sleep**: `await Bun.sleep(ms)`, never `new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))`.
- **Password hashing**: `Bun.password.hash(pw, "bcrypt")` / `Bun.password.verify(pw, hash)`.
- **String width**: `Bun.stringWidth(text, { countAnsiEscapeCodes?: false })`.
- **Wrapping**: `Bun.wrapAnsi(text, width, { wordWrap, hard, trim })`.

## Generated Files

**NEVER edit `packages/catalog/src/models.json` directly.** It is generated from upstream sources (models.dev, provider catalog discovery, OpenCode docs) by `packages/catalog/scripts/generate-models.ts` and the descriptors/resolvers in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/`. Hand-edits get overwritten on the next regen.

To change an entry, fix the source:

- **Resolution rules / per-id overrides** → relevant resolver in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/openai-compat.ts` (e.g. `createOpenCodeApiResolution`'s id-override map).
- **Provider catalog entries** (default model, discovery factory/flags) → the `CATALOG_PROVIDERS` table in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/descriptors.ts`.
- **Generator-level fixups** (premium multipliers, codex pricing fallback, fallback models, post-processing) → `packages/catalog/scripts/generate-models.ts`.
- **Thinking metadata / generated policies** → `packages/catalog/src/model-thinking.ts` (`applyGeneratedModelPolicies`); model-id classification (family/version parsing) lives in `packages/catalog/src/identity/classify.ts`.

Regenerate with `bun run gen:models` and commit `models.json` alongside the source change. Add a regression test against the **resolver/descriptor**, not the bundled JSON, so it survives upstream metadata shifts.

## Logging and CLI Output

Code that may run while the TUI, RPC, SDK, workers, or background runtimes are active MUST NOT use `console.log`/`error`/`warn`; it corrupts rendering or protocols. Use the centralized logger:

```typescript
import { logger } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";

logger.error("MCP request failed", { url, method });
logger.warn("Theme file invalid, using fallback", { path });
logger.debug("LSP fallback triggered", { reason });
```

Logs go to `~/.zz/logs/zz.YYYY-MM-DD.PID.log` with automatic rotation. Standalone CLI commands that exit without entering the TUI MAY use `console.*` or process streams for intentional user-facing output. Keep structured stdout clean. This exception is semantic, not filename-based; shared code must use `logger` or an explicit output sink.

## TUI Sanitization

All text displayed in tool renderers must be sanitized. Raw content (file contents, error messages, tool output) breaks terminal rendering: tabs → visual holes, long lines → overflow, paths → leak home directory.

**Rules:**

- **Tabs → spaces** via `replaceTabs()` (from `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui` or `../tools/render-utils`).
- **Truncate** lines with `truncateToWidth()` / `ui.truncate()`. Use `TRUNCATE_LENGTHS` constants.
- **Shorten paths** with `shortenPath()` (replaces home with `~`).
- **Preview limits** from `PREVIEW_LIMITS`. No ad-hoc numbers.

**Apply to every render path**, not just the happy one:

- Success output (file previews, command output, search results).
- **Error messages** — these often embed file content (e.g., patch failure messages include unmatched lines). If a message contains file content, it needs `replaceTabs()`.
- Diff content (added and removed).
- Streaming previews.

### Streaming tool previews

Tool-call previews can have **multiple render paths**. If you add preview-only fields or depend on partially streamed args, update every path — not only the final renderer. Streamed argument buffers decode into display args via `decodeStreamedToolArgs` / `ToolArgsRevealController` (`modes/controllers/tool-args-reveal.ts`); both the live event path and transcript rebuilds must go through them — never spread provider-parsed `arguments` next to a raw `__partialJson` (parsed args lag the stream by a throttled parse window).

For the bash tool specifically:

- The pending preview may need raw `partialJson`, not just parsed `arguments`. Parsed args lag until a JSON object closes, which makes inline env assignments appear only at the end.
- Preserve preview-only fields (e.g. `__partialJson`) through `event-controller.ts`, transcript rebuilds in `ui-helpers.ts`, and merged call/result rendering in `tool-execution.ts`. Missing one path causes inconsistent previews.
- `ToolExecutionComponent.#buildRenderContext()` for bash must work even before a result exists — the renderer uses call args plus render context to show the command preview while streaming.
- Verify both live streaming and rebuilt transcript paths after any bash preview change. A fix in one path does not fix the other.

## Commands

- NEVER commit unless asked.
- Never use `tsc`/`npx tsc` — always `bun check`.
- Merge commits (maintainer merges of PRs) follow: `Merge PR #<number>: <conventional PR subject> (@<author>)` — e.g. `Merge PR #6386: feat(catalog): add native Meta Model API provider (@eggpeat)`.

## Testing Guidance

Test the contract the system exposes — not the easiest internal detail to assert.

- Every new test must defend one **concrete, externally observable contract**: behavior, output shape, state transition, error mapping, or a regression-prone parsing boundary. If you cannot name the contract, do not add the test.
- No placeholder tests, tautologies, or "the code ran" assertions (`expect(true).toBe(true)`, bare `not.toThrow()`, non-empty string checks, length-grew checks, "prompt exists" checks without semantic assertion).
- Prefer contract-level tests over implementation details. Avoid asserting internal helper wiring, field assignment, singleton identity, incidental ordering, prompt boilerplate, or passthrough option forwarding unless another component depends on that exact detail.
- Don't duplicate coverage across abstraction levels. If an integration test already proves the behavior, drop the narrower unit test that restates it through mocks.
- Tests **must be full-suite safe**, not just file-local safe. No long-lived file-wide mutations of `Bun.*`, `process.platform`, `process.env`, or `Bun.env` when a narrower seam exists. Prefer per-test `vi.spyOn(...)` with `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`. A test that passes alone but poisons later files is broken.
- **Never use `mock.module()`**. Bun's `mock.module()` mutates the global module registry and leaks across files ([oven-sh/bun#12823](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/12823)). Use `spyOn` on the imported module object instead. For pass deps, import the pass and spy on `.run`. For package deps, namespace-import and spy on the exported function.
- For lifecycle/stateful code, prefer one test per invariant or transition over several tiny tests asserting one field each from the same transition.
- For error handling, trigger the real failure path and assert the surfaced contract — don't instantiate error classes directly or inspect internal metadata.
- Smoke tests are acceptable only when they catch a failure mode narrower tests would miss. "Package boots" or "command starts" alone is not enough.
- Assert exact strings, ordering, and formatting only when downstream code parses or depends on the exact bytes. Otherwise assert semantic content.
- Compile-time guarantees → type checks/type tests, not runtime placeholders.
- **Never source-grep.** A test that reads an implementation file (`.ts`/`.rs`/build script) and asserts on its _text_ — `expect(src).toContain("someCall()")`, `.toMatch(/import .../)`, `.not.toContain("oldName")`, or "comment must say X" — is banned. It tests how code _looks_, not what it _does_: it breaks on harmless refactors (comment reflow, rename, import reorder) and passes while the behavior is broken. Assert the observable contract instead (run the code, check output/state/error), use the runtime smoke probe for wiring you cannot exercise in-process, and enforce structural invariants (no value-import of X, no self-import) with a type test or a lint/biome rule — never a string scan of the source. (Reading a file your code _wrote_ — apply-patch result, generated bundle, temp fixture — and asserting on that output is fine; that is behavior, not a source grep.)
- Don't add tests for tiny low-risk changes unless they protect a real contract or fix a regression-prone edge case.
- Prefer focused package-local verification for the changed area.

## Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (per package).

**Format** — sections under `## [Unreleased]`:

- `### Breaking Changes` (first if present)
- `### Added`
- `### Changed`
- `### Fixed`
- `### Removed`

**Rules:**

- New entries always go under `## [Unreleased]`.
- Never modify already-released sections (e.g., `## [0.12.2]`) — they are immutable.
- Don't flag changelog section order or formatting in reviews or PRs — `bun run release` runs `fix-changelogs` which normalizes everything automatically.

**Attribution:**

- Internal (from issues): `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/123))`.
- External contributions: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`.

## Releasing

1. Ensure all changes since last release are in each affected package's `[Unreleased]` section.
2. Run `bun run release`.

The script handles version bump, CHANGELOG finalization, commit, tag, publish, and adding new `[Unreleased]` sections.
